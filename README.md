# Log-In

This is a simpleÂ iOS login screen written in Swift 5. It has the classic email & password format.


# Prerequisites

Make sure you have cocoapods installed on your computer, and if you don't you can just copy the following line in terminal and run it :

```
 $ sudo gem install cocoapods
 ```


# Installation and configuration

First, you need to clone this repository, in order to fetch the code.

```
 $ https://github.com/cotte06/Log-In.git
 ```

In order to compile your code, you need to install the dependencies first (in our case, the Firebase pods). You can simply do this by running the following command in Terminal (cd in your corresponding file) :

```
$ pod install
```

Once the pods were installed properly, open Prueba.xcworkspace with Xcode and run the project.
